# Subway-Delay-Prediction


Subway Delay Predictor is an intelligent mobile application built on a serverless platform. The application uses the historic weather and subway delay time data from the year 2015 to predict subway delay time based on the weather predicted for the next five days. The project focuses on creating a scalable architecture to accept input from the user, predict from a collection of data and store the results for further analysis on the AWS platform.
